    "The project consists of multiple problems. Each problem will utilize functions you wrote for the previous problems, so we strongly suggest that implement and test these functions in the given order. We have provided the following template that you can use to get you started. It includes the signatures (name, parameters, and docstrings) for all of the functions that you will need to write. The code however, simply returns some arbitrary value no matter what the inputs are, so you will need to modify the body of the function to work correctly. You should not change the signature of any of the functions in the template, but you may add any code that you need to. You can also download all of the files used by OwlTest when testing your code as a zip file.\n",

You will need to implement this project using desktop Python since CodeSkulptor3 can not access your local file system for security reasons.
