If something goes wrong, you will likely want to write smaller tests to help you understand how your code is working anyway. OwlTest uses smaller files to allow more targeted and understandable testing. You can use those files on your own, as well. Once you have everything working, you should be able to operate on the real data."

The key step in this process is reconciling Pygal country codes/names with the World Bank country names. So, you first must write a function called reconcile_countries_by_name\\color{red}{\\verb|reconcile_countries_by_name|}reconcile_countries_by_name which takes plot_countries\\color{red}{\\verb|plot_countries|}plot_countries, a dictionary mapping country codes used by a plot library (such as Pygal) to the corresponding country name, and gdp_countries\\color{red}{\\verb|gdp_countries|}gdp_countries, a dictionary whose keys are the country names used within the GDP data. The values in the gdp_countries\\color{red}{\\verb|gdp_countries|}gdp_countries dictionary are irrelevant for this function, but presumably contain GDP data for each country. The reconcile_countries_by_name\\color{red}{\\verb|reconcile_countries_by_name|}reconcile_countries_by_name function should return a dictionary and a set.
