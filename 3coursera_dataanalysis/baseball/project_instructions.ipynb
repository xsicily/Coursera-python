    "Data Science is a rapidly growing discipline in which large amounts of data are analyzed to extract knowledge and insight from that data. That insight can be used to better explain the past, predict the future, or otherwise make decisions based on data rather than intuition. In this project, we will introduce you to some of the basic tools of data analysis. We will do some basic analyses on Baseball statistics. Large amounts of data on baseball is readily available, making it an ideal topic to explore the ideas behind large scale data analysis. While the particular analyses you will perform are specific to baseball, the underlying ideas and strategies for analyzing data are not.\n",

For this project, we will provide you with a several CSV files that contain data on the performance of Major League Baseball (MLB) player over a span of more than a century. You will build upon the work you did in the previous project to statistically analyze this data. This historical baseball data can be found at seanlehman.com in his baseball archive.

Since this data is being updated regularly, we ask that you use the 2016 versions of this two files linked here: Master_2016.csv and Batting_2016.csv.

In fact, the values of the computed statistic will always be different by at least 0.000010.000010.00001. So, you do not need to write any code to deal with the case where there is a tie.

This code calls the functions you have written to compute top players based on various statistics. However, this code only works once you have written all of the functions and it operates on the full baseball data set. We strongly recommend you write smaller tests and utilize OwlTest to test each function individually. If something goes wrong, you will likely want to write smaller tests to help you understand how your code is working anyway. OwlTest uses smaller files to allow more targeted and understandable testing. You can use those files on your own, as well."
